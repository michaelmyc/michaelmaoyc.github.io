Overview Making good hyperlapse videos is difficult. It usually requires photographers to take photos between consistent distance intervals and keep the height of the camera and the direction of the lens steady and smooth. Alternatively, they can mount their camera on expensive steadicams or gimbals. To make creating high-quality hyperlapses easier, we present HUSTL (Hyper-Ultra-Super-Time-Lapse), an open source three-stage software pipeline based on the state of the art academic research papers.</description></item><item><title>Californian Milky Way</title><link/><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid/><description/></item><item><title>Personal Website</title><link>https://michaelmao.me/project/personal-website/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Oct 2022 00:36:54 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://michaelmao.me/project/personal-website/</guid><description>Home page layout

Overview OKAI is an interactive introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI). The project aims to demystify and introduce machine learning and deep learning concepts to a broader audience with limited or no background in computer science. It utilizes web-based interactive graphics and animations to visualize the working principles of a simple feed-forward neural net classifier on the MNIST dataset.</description></item><item><title>Example Blogpost</title><link>https://michaelmao.me/blog/example-blogpost/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Oct 2022 00:36:54 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://michaelmao.me/blog/example-blogpost/</guid><description>Example Text Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Abstract With the rapid proliferation of large datasets, efficient data compression has become more important than ever. Columnar compression techniques (e.g., dictionary encoding, runlength encoding, delta encoding) have proved highly effective for tabular data, but they typically compress individual columns without considering potential relationships among columns, such as functional dependencies and correlations. Semantic compression techniques, on the other hand, are designed to leverage such relationships to store only a subset of the columns necessary to infer the others, but existing approaches cannot effectively identify complex relationships across more than a few columns at a time.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://michaelmao.me/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://michaelmao.me/about/</guid><description>My name is Michael Mao. I am currently an algorithm engineer at Shukun Technology developing AI algorithms and foundational models for medical imaging and other medical purposes.
My research interest lies mainly in natural language processing, computer vision, multi-modal learning, and their medical applications. You can learn more about what motivates me in my mission page.
In my free time, I enjoy photography, visiting museums, visiting places of man-made and natural beauty, and tinkering with 3D printing technologies.</description></item><item><title>Mission</title><link>https://michaelmao.me/mission/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://michaelmao.me/mission/</guid><description>Work In Progress</description></item></channel></rss>
